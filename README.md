# :hammer_and_wrench: TampermonkeyMiscellaneous

A collection of various user scripts for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) that don't require a dedicated repository. This repo includes useful, experimental, or just fun scripts designed to enhance web experience, automate repetitive tasks, or add small features to websites.

## :file_folder: Repository Structure

Each script is organized in its own folder and typically contains:

- `*.user.js` — the main script file  
- `README.md` — description, usage, and installation guide  
- Additional files if needed (icons, stylesheets, helper scripts, etc.)
