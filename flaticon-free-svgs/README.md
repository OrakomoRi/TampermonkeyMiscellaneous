# Free SVGs on Flaticon

Tampermonkey user script that adds buttons to download SVG icons for free on [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/), even for premium-only icons.  
You must be **logged in** for this to work.

Inspired by [JohnDeved's flaticon-svg-hack](https://github.com/JohnDeved/flaticon-svg-hack).

## :gear: Features

- Adds a button to the download page to get the SVG directly
- Adds a button on the editor page to download the raw SVG
- Works automatically when new icons appear on the page
- No need to inspect HTML or mess with devtools

## :bulb: Getting Started

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension if you haven't already.
2. Install the script from [this link](https://github.com/OrakomoRi/TampermonkeyMiscellaneous/blob/main/flaticon-free-svgs/userscript.user.js?raw=true).

> Make sure you are logged in to Flaticon. The download won't work otherwise.
